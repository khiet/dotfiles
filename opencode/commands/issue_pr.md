# PR Description Generator

Generate a concise GitHub PR description based on the current branch and recent commits. If a PR doesn't exist, create one. If it exists, output the generated description for review (do not auto-update to preserve any manual edits like screenshots) and confirm if I want to overwrite.

## Process

1. **Prepare codebase with separate commits**
   - Whenever making any changes to the codebase (e.g., adding a missing test, linting, or other fixes), create a separate commit for each logical change.
   - Run the project's linter with auto-fix enabled. If changes were made, commit specifically with message: "Auto-format and lint fixes".

2. **Gather branch information:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -10
   git diff main...HEAD --name-only
   git diff main...HEAD --stat
   ```

3. **Analyze test coverage** for PR changes only (not full codebase)

4. **Generate PR description** following the template below

5. **Handle PR:**
   - Check if PR exists: `gh pr view`
   - If no PR exists: create with `gh pr create`, then run `open <pr_url>` to open it in the browser
   - If PR exists: output the generated description for user to review/copy

## PR Template

```markdown
## Summary

- [Max 3 bullets]

## Test Plan

- [ ] Verified existing tests pass
- [ ] [Specific verification steps for the changes]
- [ ] [Note any missing test coverage]
```
